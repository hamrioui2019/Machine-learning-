# Machine-learning-

In this repository, I going to share my evolution in data-visualization. It might not the reference of a data scientist but I am trying to improve my skills in machine learning.

First, we are going to start with the first approach which is supervised machine learning: KNN, decision tree, linear regression, Bayes, machine learning gradient descent... Then, we are going to see unsupervised machine learning with clustering (K-means), Neural networks, and Dimensionality Reduction. Let's get started.
